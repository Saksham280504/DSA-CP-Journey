    // Minimum Spanning Tree:-

    // We will be given an undirected weighted graph with n nodes and m edges.

    // A tree in which we have n nodes and n-1 edges & all nodes are reachable from each other is known as a spanning tree.

    // For any given graph we can have multiple spanning trees.

    // Minimum spanning tree (MST) is the spanning tree which has the minimum weighted sum than others.

    // A graph can also have multiple MSTs too.

    // To find out MSTs of a graph, we use two algorithms:
    // 1. Prim's Algorithm
    // 2. Kruskal's Algorithm (Disjoint sets)
