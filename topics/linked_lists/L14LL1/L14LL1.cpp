    // LinkedList is a collection of elements of similar datatype, and elements are not stored at contiguous locations. Also, the size of the linkedList is not fixed, it can be modified.

    // The first element of the linkedList is known as Head of the LinkedList.

    // The last element of the linkedList is known as Tail of the LinkedList.

    // Every element of the linkedList contains a value, and the location of the next element. So, in order to traverse the entire linkedList we use the next-pointer system.

    // The last element contains null/nullptr in next.
